Q3 (Covers Block 3)

(a) A computer has a single processor of one core. It has 16 general purpose registers. The
machine has 64 KB RAM. The size of each register and memory word is 32 bits. The
computer uses fixed length instructions of size 32 bits each. An instruction of the machine
can have two operands — the first operand is a memory operand and the second operand is a
register operand (register operand can be a general purpose register). Memory operand uses
direct addressing, however, register operand use either register direct or register indirect
addressing. (Please note that if register operand uses register indirect addressing, then the
stated register contains the address of the operand in the memory.) An instruction of a
machine consists of bits for operation code, one bit for addressing mode, bits for one
memory operand and bits for one register operand. The machine has about 200 different
operation codes. The addressing mode bits specifies addressing mode as:

 

Addressing mode bit | Register Operand | Memory Operand
0 Indirect Direct
1 Direct Direct

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The special purpose registers, which are other than general purpose registers, are - Program
Counter (PC), Memory Address Register (MAR), Data Register (DR) and Flag registers
(FR). The First register of the general purpose registers can be used as Accumulator Register.
The size of Integer operands on the machine may be assumed to be equal to the size of
accumulator register. In order to execute instructions the machine has another special register
called Instruction Register (IR) of size 32 bits, as each instruction is of this size. Perform the
following tasks for the machine. (Make and state suitable assumptions, if any.)

(i) Design suitable instruction formats for the machine. Specify the size of different fields
that are needed in the instruction format. Also indicate how many bits of the instructions
are unused for this machine. Explain your design of instruction format. (3 Marks)

(ii) List at least two valid instructions, and put some valid data values in registers and
memory locations, and demonstrate examples of different addressing modes for this
machine. (2 Marks)

(ii) Assuming that the instructions are first fetched to Instruction Register (IR), memory
operand is brought to DR register, and result of an operation is stored in the Accumulator
register; write and explain the sequence of micro-operations that are required to fetch and
execute an instruction, which performs addition of two operands having addressing mode
bits as 1. Please note that one of the operand is direct memory operand and second is an
Register Operand. Make and state suitable assumptions, if any. (5 Marks)

(b) Assume that you have a machine as shown in section 3.2.2 of Block 3 having the micro-
operations as given in Figure 10 on page 62 of Block 3. Consider that R1 and R2 both are 8
bit registers and contains 01010101 and 10011010 respectively. What will be the values of
select inputs, carry-in input and result of operation (including carry out bit) if the following
micro-operations are performed? (For each micro-operation you may assume the initial
value of R1 and R2 as given above) (2 Marks)
(i) Increment R1
(ii) Subtract R2 from R1 with borrow
(iii)Exclusive OR of R1 and R2
(iv) Shift left R1

(c) Explain the Instruction pipelining. Also explain the problems of instruction pipelining.
(3 Marks)

(d) Explain the organisation of control memory with the help of a diagram. Also differentiate
between Horizontal and vertical micro-instructions. (2 Marks)

(e) What are the advantages of Large Register file in RISC? Explain with the help of a diagram.
Also explain the concept of RISC pipelining. (3 Marks)

Q4 (Covers Block 4)

(a) Write a program using 8086 assembly Language (with proper comments) that accepts a
single character input from the keyboard, if this character is '+' then the program adds two
six byte arrays stored in the memory into a third array in the memory, otherwise program
simply terminates. Make suitable assumptions, if any. (The effect of addition should be
similar to the array operation like:

for i=1 to 6 {Cfi]=Afi]+Bfi};} ) (7 Marks)
(b) Write a program using 8086 assembly Language (with proper comments) that finds the top
two values in an array of positive numbers stored in an array of size 10. (7 Marks)

(c) Explain the following in the context of 8086 Microprocessor: (6 Marks)
(i) Physical address calculation using CS:IP and SS:SP pairs
(ii) Processing of software Interrupts in 8086 microprocessor

This assignment has seven questions. Answer all questions. Please go through the
guidelines regarding assignments given in the Programme Guide for the format of
presentation.

Ql:

Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow:

Whatever the type of job interview — a walk-in, a telephone interview or a regular in-person
job interview, preparation is the key. It is important that you keep yourself in a state of high
motivation and readiness, making optimum use of your time to equip yourself to excel. Here are
a few things you'd like to do for sure, by way of preparation.

You are certain to be asked specific questions about your potential employer, so make sure
you've done your homework on company information like company history, recent
performance, their last year's profits and latest product launches. Nothing is as disappointing as
when a candidate shows enthusiasm and then doesn’t even know the most basic facts and
figures about the company. So, where can you find all this information? The most likely place
is the Internet. A visit to the company website could help you get all the vital statistics,
including products and services as well as a feel of the company culture. You must also check
out the annual report and look for a press or company news page. Put their name into a search
engine to see if they’ve had any recent interesting stories written about them. It is also advisable
to tap industry sources, trade journals, newspapers and other business publications to give you
good background knowledge of the industry as well as the company.

Talk to people who work in the company or in similar companies / areas to gather as much
information as you can about the nature of work, responsibilities, work culture and work
requirements.

For the interview, you need to know your CV inside out. Go through your CV carefully and
make notes on how you will elaborate or illustrate what you have stated. You need to be ready
with examples from your experience to be able to substantiate all the claims you have made.
Try to relate specific areas of your CV back to the job description. It will make it clear to the
interviewer why they should hire you. Also go through the copy of your application carefully
before the interview. The interview panel is likely to ask specific questions about it.

11
Going for a job interview is no different from going for an exam. It is important that you go
well prepared and confident so that you can field any question that is put to you.

Before the Interview

Apart from finding out about the company and being thorough with your CV, it would be
helpful to follow these tips:

e Make a rational assessment of yourself before you go for the interview. Know your
strengths and weaknesses.

Review your skills and abilities.

Have a mock interview with a friend based on the common interview questions you're
likely to face.

e If you are asked to bring certificates, references, etc, get them ready well in advance to
avoid having to chase around them on the morning of the big day.

e If you have filled up a statement of purpose as part of the application, be ready for some
probing questions based on this.
Be sure you know the time, date and location of the interview.
Decide how you will get there and when you need to set off to arrive in good time,
anticipating any delays. Visit the place once beforehand if possible.

e = If you look good, you tend to feel good too. Avoid any last minute panic by preparing what
you're going to wear the night before.

e Don’t go into the interview with lots of baggage - psychological or physical. Take the bare
minimum with you so you can concentrate on the interview, and nothing else.

e Prepare at least 5 questions that you would like to ask the panel about the company or your
job. You don’t have to ask them all. See for yourself what is most appropriate to ask during
the interview.

(a) What should be your state of mind when getting ready for a job interview? (2 Marks)

(b) Why do you need to do adequate homework about the company where you (2 Marks)

This assignment has two questions of total of 40 marks. Rest 10 marks are for viva voce.
Please go through the guidelines regarding assignments given in the programme guide for
the format of presentation.

Q1: (10 Marks)

Design a two bit down counter circuit that counts from 3 to 0. It should have states 11, 10, 01,
and 00. The initial state of the counter may be assumed to be 11. The counter will be in
following successive states: 11, 10, 01, 00, 11, 10, 01, 00, 11,... Use J-K flip flop to design the
circuit. You must design the circuit using state transition diagram and Karnaugh's maps.

Q?2: (3*10 = 30 Marks)

Write and run following programs using 8086 assembly language.

(a) Write and run a 8086 Assembly language program that converts a three digit ASCII number
stored in three consecutive byte locations in the memory, into a binary number. The output
should be stored in DX register. For example, if three consecutive byte locations contain
'345' (please note they are three ASCII digits), then the DX should get binary equivalent of
decimal number 543, which is (0000 0010 0001 1111)2. This binary value will be stored in
DX register.

(b) Write and run (using appropriate calling program) a near procedure in 8086 assembly
language, which is passed a single parameter by the calling program. The procedure checks
if the input parameter has a value zero or not. If the value of input parameter is zero then
procedure/program is terminated, otherwise a value of 1 is returned to the calling program,
which then continue to execute the remaining program. Make and state suitable assumptions,
if any.

(c) Write and run a 8086 assembly language program that finds the sum of first N natural
numbers. The value of N is input to the assembly program. The sum is stored in DX register.
Assume the value of N between 1 and 10 only.
